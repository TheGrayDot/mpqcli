# list

List files in a target MPQ archive.

## List all files in an MPQ archive

Pretty simple, list files in an MPQ archive. Useful to "pipe" to other tools, such as `grep` (see the [Advanced Examples](../advanced.md) page).

```bash
$ mpqcli list wow-patch.mpq
BM_COKETENT01.BLP
Blizzard_CraftUI.xml
CreatureSoundData.dbc
...
Blizzard_CraftUI.lua
30ee7bd3959906e358eff01332cf045e.blp
realmlist.wtf
```

## List all files with detailed output

Similar to the `ls` command with the `-l` and `-a` options, additional detailed information can be included with the `list` subcommand. The `-a` option includes printing "special" files used in MPQ archives including: `(listfile)`, `(attributes)` and `(signature)`.

```bash
$ mpqcli list -d -a wow-patch.mpq
   88604 enUS 2006-03-29 02:02:37  BM_COKETENT01.BLP
     243 enUS 2006-04-04 21:28:14  Blizzard_CraftUI.xml
     388 enUS 2006-03-29 19:32:46  CreatureSoundData.dbc
     ...
     184 enUS 2006-04-04 21:28:14  Blizzard_CraftUI.lua
   44900 enUS 2006-03-29 02:01:02  30ee7bd3959906e358eff01332cf045e.blp

```

## List specific properties

The `list` subcommand supports listing the following properties:

- `hash-index` - Index in the hash table where the file entry is.
- `name-hash1` - The first hash of the file name.
- `name-hash2` - The second hash of the file name.
- `name-hash3` - 64-bit Jenkins hash of the file name, used for searching in the HET table.
- `locale` - Locale info of the file.
- `file-index` - Index in the file table of the file.
- `byte-offset` - Offset of the file in the MPQ, relative to the MPQ header.
- `file-time` - Timestamp of the file.
- `file-size` - Uncompressed file size of the file, in bytes.
- `compressed-size` - Compressed file size of the file, in bytes.
- `encryption-key` - Encryption key for the file.
- `encryption-key-raw` - Encryption key for the file.
- `flags` - File flags for the file within MPQ:
  * `i`: File is Imploded (By PKWARE Data Compression Library).
  * `c`: File is Compressed (By any of multiple methods).
  * `e`: File is Encrypted.
  * `2`: File is Encrypted with key v2.
  * `p`: File is a Patch file.
  * `u`: File is stored as a single Unit, rather than split into sectors.
  * `d`: File is a Deletion marker. Used in MPQ patches, indicating that the file no longer exists.
  * `r`: File has Sector CRC checksums for each sector. This is ignored if the file is not compressed or imploded.
  * `s`: Present on STANDARD.SNP\(signature).
  * `x`: File exists; this is reset if the file is deleted.
  * `m`: Mask for a file being compressed.
  * `n`: Use default flags for internal files.
  * `f`: Fix key; This is obsolete.

You can use the `-p` or `--property` argument with the `list` subcommand to print the given properties. Many properties can be given, and they will be printed in the order given.

```bash
$ mpqcli list -d -a Patch_rt.mpq -p hash-index -p locale -p flags

## List all files with an external listfile

Older MPQ archives do not contain (complete) file paths of their content. By using the `-l` or `--listfile` argument, one can provide an external listfile that lists the content of the MPQ archive, so that the listed files will have the correct paths. Listfiles can be downloaded on [Ladislav Zezula's site](http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html).

```bash
$ mpqcli list -l /path/to/listfile StarDat.mpq
```
