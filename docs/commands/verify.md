# verify

Verify a target MPQ archive signature.

## Verify an MPQ archive

Check the digital signature of an MPQ archive by verifying the signature in the archive with a collection of known Blizzard public keys (bundled in StormLib library). The tool will print if verification succeeds or fails, as well as return `0` for success and any other value for failure.

```bash
$ mpqcli verify wow-patch.mpq
[*] Verify success
```

If verification passes, a zero (`0`) exit status will be returned. This can be helpful to verify a large number of MPQ archives without the need to review the status message that is printed out.

```bash
$ echo $?
0
```

## Verify an MPQ archive and print the digital signature

Check the digital signature of an MPQ archive, by verifying the signature in the archive and also printing the digital signature value in hexadecimal using the `-p` or `--print` argument.

```bash
$ mpqcli verify -p wow-patch.mpq > signature
```
